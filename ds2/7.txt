The image contains handwritten notes with steps on how to create and deploy a Java web application. The notes are divided into two sections, likely indicating server-side and client-side steps. Here is the text:

---

(Server Side)

1. New Project
   Server
   Java Web/App

The notes appear to be instructions for setting up a calculator service using Java web technologies and deploying it to a server, as well as setting up the client side to interact with this service. The exact sequence and some parts of the steps are not fully clear, possibly due to the shorthand and abbreviations used.
